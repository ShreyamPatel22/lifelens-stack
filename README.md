# 🧠 LifeLens – AI-Powered Emergency Response Platform

**LifeLens** is an AI-assisted web application that helps users detect hazards from images, send emergency alerts, and share critical information with responders in real time.

Built with a modern **FastAPI + React + Tailwind** stack, LifeLens demonstrates a clean full-stack architecture with real deployments via **Render** (backend) and **Firebase Hosting** (frontend).
